=head1 NAME

XPanel - Perl extension to XPanel servers

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use XPanel;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a placeholder for now for XPanel:: modules.

I'm doing this as a XPanel L<http://www.xpanel.com> developer for future development of our public API.

=head1 USING THE XPanel:: namespace

If you'd like to use the XPanel namespace in your modules, please use XPanel::3rdparty  or XPanel::My as your 
base namespace to avoid confusion with modules released by XPanel, Inc.

Thank you very much for your consideration in this matter.
